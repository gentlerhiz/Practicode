## Slide 2: The Problem
**Nigeria's Tech Ecosystem Challenge**

**The Education Gap:**
- 85% of tech graduates lack practical, job-ready skills
- Traditional courses cost ₦300k-₦500k with little hands-on training
- Theory-heavy curriculums produce unemployable graduates

**The Business Gap:**
- Small businesses (retailers, schools, clinics) operate manually
- Custom software costs ₦500k-₦2M+—unaffordable for SMEs
- No middle-ground solution exists

**The Result:**
- Talented youth can't access affordable practical training
- Businesses can't afford digital transformation
- Both markets remain underserved

**Quote:** *"I hire graduates who can't build a simple website. And small businesses tell me they can't afford my ₦800k quote for basic systems."* — Nigerian Developer
